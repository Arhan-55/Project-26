# Black Forest Cake
<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">**Black Forest gâteau or Black Forest cake is a chocolate sponge cake with a rich cherry filling based on the German**
**dessert Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte, literally "Black Forest Cherry-torte". Typically, Black Forest gateau consists of**
**several layers of chocolate sponge cake sandwiched with whipped cream and cherries. It was discovered by Josef Keller, A chef from Germany.**</span>

# Ingredients
**1.**  **9 large eggs, room temp**
<br>**2.**  **1 cup granulated sugar**
<br>**3.**  **1 cup all-purpose flour (measured correctly)**
<br>**4.**  **1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder**
<br>**5.**  **4 Tbsp (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled to room temp**
<br>**6.**  **1/2 tsp vanilla extract**

# Recipe
**Step 1 :**  **Beat 9 large eggs with the whisk attachment for 1 min on high speed. With the mixer on, gradually add 1 cup sugar and  continue beating on high speed a full 8 min. It will be thick and fluffy.**

**Step 2 :**  **Whisk together 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup cocoa powder and sift in thirds into the batter, folding with a spatula
between each addition. Once all flour is in, continue to fold just until no streaks of flour remain, scraping the bottom 
of the bowl to get any pockets of flour hiding at the bottom; do not over-mix or you will deflate the batter.**

**Step 3 :**  **Gently fold in 1/2 tsp vanilla and room temp butter, folding as you add butter in a steady stream and scraping 
from the bottom to make sure you don’t have butter pooling at the bottom. Fold just until incorporated. Divide batter 
equally between two prepared cake pans and BAKE RIGHT AWAY in fully preheated oven at 350˚F for 20-25 minutes (my oven 
took 22 min), or until a toothpick comes out clean. *Note: Once the butter is added, it must be transferred to baking 
pans and put into the oven immediately or the batter can deflate quickly**.

**Step 4 :**  **Let cool in pans for 10 min then run a knife or thin edged spatula around the edges to loosen cake. Transfer to a 
wire rack and remove parchment backing. When cakes are at room temp, and you’re ready to assemble, slice cake layers in 
half with a long serrated knife.**

**Step 5 :**  **To make the syrup you need roughly chop pitted cherries and place them in a medium bowl with 3 Tbsp kirsch. Let 
sit at room temp for at least 30 min, stirring a couple times, then drain cherries in a sieve over a bowl. Keep the 
cherries and syrup. Add 1/4 cup cold filtered water to the syrup to get about 3/4 cup total syrup.**

**Step 6 :**  **Beat 3 1/2 cups heavy cream with whisk attachment on high speed until soft peaks form, add 1/3 cup powdered sugar 
and 1 Tbsp kirsch and beat on high until stiff and spreadable (1-2 min). Refrigerate until ready to use (tip: keep whisk 
attachment in the bowl – you can whip it another 30 seconds if it seems slightly loose after refrigeration).**

**Step 7 :**  **Now for assembling the cake, Place first cake layer on a cake stand and brush with 1/4 of the syrup. Cover the 
top with about 3/4 cup frosting (3 ice cream scoops’ worth) and top with 1/3 of the chopped cherries. Repeat with 
remaining layers and top with the flattest layer. Transfer 1 1/2 cups frosting to a pastry bag with a large flower tip 
and refrigerate until ready to use (don’t handle the bag too much or the cream will soften). Fill the cracks along the 
sides of cake with frosting then frost the top and sides with remaining frosting.**

**Step 8 :**  **To make chocolate shavings, you can either melt chocolate in the microwave, spread it thin over the back of a 
baking sheet with the help of a food scraper, then refrigerate a few minutes and use a food scraper to create bark-like 
shavings. This is the more authentic way. Alternatively, you can use a potato peeler to shave a chunk of chocolate, It 
will still be pretty but it won’t have the same “black forest cake” feel to it.**

**Step 9 :**  **Cover sides and top of cake with chocolate shavings leaving a 1″ perimeter on top for piping frosting. Pipe 
rounds of frosting around the top of the cake and place a whole cherry over each one. Refrigerate cake for at least 4 
hours or overnight before serving for the flavors to meld.**
